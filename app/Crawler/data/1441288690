Big Data Analytics Engineer		MIT Lincoln Laboratory		Lexington, MA, US		<div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><strong>Listing Info<br /><br /></strong>Group 58—Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems<br />The United States Government faces serious threats from sophisticated cyber adversaries who seek to access, compromise, and disrupt systems and the missions they support. The Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems Group strives to improve the security of these government systems through the development and deployment innovative cyber security solutions that rely on the application of sound scientific and engineering principles and methodologies. We develop threat models, measures and metrics for security, novel analytics for discovery and characterization of cyber actors and scalable human-assistive cyber decision support tools. In each of the group’s R&amp;D areas, emphasis is placed on realistic data and rigorous experimental evaluation of techniques. Projects are carried out by small, focused, cooperative teams that succeed together by participating in all phases of technical solution development, including problem analysis, innovative solution design, system architecture, solution prototyping and field-testing and final tech-transfer to DoD and Intelligence Community sponsors or industry.<br /><br />Members of the Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems Group are creative, motivated self-starters who share a common passion for helping to solve critical National cyber security problems. We are computer scientists, mathematicians, machine learning researchers and practitioners, system analysts and security architects who firmly believe we can make a difference in the security of the nation. We are growing our team to meet national needs and seek like-minded individuals who want to work on challenging problems in the supportive, flexible, applied academic environment that is MIT Lincoln Laboratory.<br /><br /><strong>Big Data Analytics Engineer<br /><br /></strong>The successful candidate will work with a team of researchers to develop algorithms and analytics for discovery and characterization from voluminous and noisy data. This work will support all aspects of computer network operations and security, including intelligence, situational awareness, and decision support. Research will involve data mining, statistical modeling, and software development to characterize cyber systems and user behavior at multiple scales and multiple levels of abstraction. Results will impact programs of national importance and be published in academic conferences and journals.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements<br /><br /></strong>MS in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or a related field. In lieu of an MS, a BS in a similar field and 3+ years of work experience will be considered. Must be able to work with a team to design, develop, test, and analyze complex models and analytics to support national challenges. Ability to demonstrate effective communication skills with team members and managers is essential.<br /><br /><strong>Desired Skills<br /><br /></strong>Knowledge of Matlab, R, Java, or Python is highly desired, as is experience with Hadoop, MapReduce, or related big-data architectures. Experience with any combination of the following is desired: machine learning, statistical modeling, computer and network security, simulation modeling, cyber threat modeling, game theory, user behavior modeling, computational intelligence, agent-based systems, data mining, visualization, and risk assessment. Strong written communication skills are highly desired, and candidates with a demonstrated publication history will be given strong consideration.<br /><br />MIT Lincoln Laboratory is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment and will not be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, veteran status, disability status, or genetic information<br /><br />U.S. citizenship is required.<br /><br /></div><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">MIT Lincoln Laboratory is a federally funded research and development center chartered to apply advanced technology to problems of national security.
