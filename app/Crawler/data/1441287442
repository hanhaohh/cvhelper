The hiring market is large, complex and opaque. Job seekers are left to wander their personal networks or scour long lists of semi-relevant opportunities. Employers are stuck with the expensive, time-consuming task of weeding through large volumes of poorly qualified resumes from untargeted sources, or else paying high fees to recruiters.<br /> <br />At Cognius, this is exactly the type of problem we thrive on fixing; We love inefficiency. Not in ourselves, but in the markets we go after. Why? Because we’re good at optimizing, and inefficient markets present huge opportunities to create transformational businesses. We’re starting out with a profitable business model, an audience of millions of job-seekers each month, and backing from some the most successful entrepreneurs in Boston.</p></div>
