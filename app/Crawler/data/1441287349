The organization was founded in 1936 when advertising first flooded the mass media. Consumers lacked a reliable source of information they could depend on to help them distinguish hype from fact and good products from bad ones. Since then CR has filled that vacuum with a broad range of consumer information. To maintain its independence and impartiality, CR accepts no outside advertising and no free samples and employs several hundred mystery shoppers and technical experts to buy and test the products it evaluates. <br /> <br />Consumer Reports, is one of the top-circulation magazines in the country, and ConsumerReports.org has the most subscribers of any website of its kind. In addition, the company pubishes two newsletters—Consumer Reports on Health and Consumer Reports Money Adviser—and ShopSmart magazine, which helps you make smart choices and get the most for your money every day. They have combined subscriptions of more than 8 million. All of CR’s work is informed by the more than 1 million readers who respond to our Annual Ballot &amp; Questionnaire, among the largest and most comprehensive consumer studies in the world. In 2008, CR also launched several initiatives, including ConsumerReportsHealth.org and the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center, which serve to educate and empower consumers to make more informed health-care decisions and to help change the market. <br /> <br />To further advance its mission, Consumer Reports employs a dedicated staff of lobbyists, grassroots organizers, and outreach specialists who work with the organization’s more than 600,000 online activists to change legislation and the marketplace in favor of the consumer interest. <br /> <br />The organization is headquartered in Yonkers, NY with additional offices in Manhattan, Austin, San Francisco, Washington DC, and East Haddam CT. </p><p></p><p>Quick Facts: </p><p><br />• Technology push and development of Consumer Reports Mobile Products &amp; Services which include; Consumer Reports iPad® App, Consumer Reports Ratings App, Consumerist Tipster, and coming soon the much demanded Consumer Reports Cars App all available on iOS and Android devices. </p><p></p><p>• Consumer Reports is maintaining solid readership in both newsstand sales and subscriptions during a period in which other magazine publishers are reporting declines.
