We are developing a future where the bricks and mortar model of banking is a thing of the past.<br /> <br />Moven does everything your bank does, but better. Customers can make mobile payments with ease via a MasterCard PayPass payment sticker, deposit checks from anywhere using their smartphone, and pay a friend via Facebook. <br /><br />Where Moven differs from traditional retail banking, is our fundamentally different view of where mobile ﬁts within banking. By providing customers with contextual information about their spending behaviors, as they happen at the point-of-sale, customers become conditioned to make better ﬁnancial decisions on the spot. It restores control and allows customers to make smarter spending and saving decisions.</p></div>
