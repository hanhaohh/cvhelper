The 11 buildings that now make up the Horseshoe frame a lush lawn that is an irresistible gathering place.<br /> <br />The university is expanding west toward the Congaree River in support of its research initiatives in nanotechnology, health sciences, Future Fuels™, the environment and information and knowledge technologies. Three separate sites, each specializing in its own research area, will comprise this new innovation district, called Innovista. It will initially cover 500,000 square feet spread over about six city blocks but is projected to grow to five million square feet, mixing University and private research buildings, parking garages, and commercial and residential units around a public plaza called Foundation Square. By creating space for residences, retail, restaurants, and recreation that will complement the research, Innovista will be a place to live, learn, and work.<br /> <br />Joining the flagship campus in Columbia, are four-year campuses in Aiken, Beaufort and Upstate (Spartanburg-Greenville). Four two-year campuses—Lancaster, Sumter, Salkehatchie (Allendale and Walterboro) and Union—help the university cover the state.</p></div>
