At InterWorks, we’re more interested in candidates who are hard-working, smart, and love what they do. We care more about overall database and analytical skills rather than experience with a certain database platform. Whether you have worked primarily in SQL Server, Oracle, or something else, we only ask that you have a strong understanding of SQL as a whole and can apply your skills within our fast paced and agile approach.<br /><br />While some companies may hide their data engineers away in some dungeon, data engineers at InterWorks are social, friendly creatures.
