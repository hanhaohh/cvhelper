Low Carbon Modeling Intern		World Resources Institute		Washington, D.C., DC, US		<div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><strong>Listing Info<br /><br /></strong>WRI&rsquo;s Open Climate Network, CAIT team and the Economics Center are seeking a detail-oriented and highly organized individual to provide support for the work related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions modeling at national level, online modelling tools and visualization for decarbonization pathways. This is an excellent position for someone seeking to gain knowledge of environmental communications strategies, exposure to WRI&rsquo;s economic analysis, and experience operating within a respected international environmental organization.<br /><br />The Open Climate Network (OCN) brings together independent research institutes and civil society groups from key countries to track and report on their countries&rsquo; progress toward addressing climate change.<br /><br />The CAIT Climate Data Explorer is WRI&rsquo;s online climate and energy public data explorer. For nearly a decade, CAIT has been a leading online destination for international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other key climate data, providing data tables, maps, and charts for view and download. It offers an emissions projections module, which this intern will help to update.<br /><br />WRI&rsquo;s Economics Center helps provide a better understanding of the value that ecosystems provide to the economy. We use an economics lens to analyze problems and solutions at the intersection of environment and human well-being. We conduct in-depth economic assessments of the value of terrestrial and marine ecosystem services, renewable energy investments, and the impact of climate vulnerability for communities and their livelihoods and more. We develop tools and guidance to help decision-makers understand the economic and social trade-offs of investing in and protecting natural resources.<br /><br /><strong>The Intern Will Gain Experience In The Following Areas<br /></strong><ul><li>Assisting in research and synthesis of materials, and in organizing, analyzing and presenting relevant data on models, scenarios, assumptions and interactive use of on-line modelling tools on decarbonization pathways</li><li>Assisting in a comprehensive online research of methodologies of integrated assessment models and related assessment tools</li><li>Support on the scoping work for identifying demand and feasibility of a web-based portal to share and compare a wide range of assumptions, baselines, and scenario results from energy and climate modeling exercises around the world</li><li>Assessing stakeholder needs and developing policy use cases for new and improved decarbonzation modeling</li><li>Supporting the updates of the emissions projections within WRI&rsquo;s CAIT Climate Data Explorer</li><li>Drafting other notes or inputs to research reports/tools as required<br /><br /></li></ul></div><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">WRI's mission is to move human society to live in ways that protect Earth’s environment and its capacity to provide for the needs and aspirations of current and future generations.<br /><br />We organize our work around six critical goals that the world must achieve this decade in order to secure a sustainable future:<br /><br />Climate: Protect communities and natural ecosystems from damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and generate opportunities for people by catalyzing a global transition to a low-carbon economy.<br /><br />Energy: Drive the scale-up of clean, affordable power systems throughout the world to deliver sustainable socio-economic development.<br /><br />Food: Ensure the world’s food systems reduce their impact on the environment, drive economic opportunity, and sustainably feed 9.6 billion people by 2050.<br /><br />Forests: Alleviate poverty, enhance food security, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change by reducing forest loss and restoring productivity to degraded, deforested lands.<br /><br />Water: Achieve a water-secure future by mapping, measuring, and mitigating global water risks.<br /><br />Cities and Transport: Improve quality of life in cities by developing and scaling environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable urban and transport solutions.<br /><br />We design solutions for and analyze these six critical goals through the lenses of our three Centers of Excellence which focus on Governance, Business and Finance.</div>
