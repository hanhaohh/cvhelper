Web Application Engineer Intern		Panjiva		Cambridge, MA, US		<div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><strong>Responsibilities<br /><br /></strong>We are seeking exceptional software engineer interns to play a leading role in Panjiva’s evolution. Some experience with full-stack web application development, both server-side and client-side, would be a good head-start. Your work will be used by millions of people from every country in the world, and by some of the largest (and smallest) companies in the world. We need hands-on hackers—not managers—but our ideal candidates have the potential to grow into a strong leadership role over time.<br />About Our Engineers<br />We’re a small team of mostly MIT computer science grads who like hacking on business models and products as much as machine learning algorithms and browser-bending javascript. We’re a bunch of generalists who work on the entire stack; a given day’s checkins may include performance tweaks to our backend data processing pipeline, an updated multivariate landing page test, a parsing expression grammar for a new data source, upgrades to our deployment infrastructure to make better use of our CDN, or new parallelizing queries to make Panjiva search faster. Most of us have started companies before (one who co-founded a venture-backed company that was sold to VMware; another was a co-founder of a YCombinator company), love programming (one of our engineers has a lambda calculus tattoo), and enjoy discussing all aspects of the business and how our work impacts the global economy. Our development environment is highly collaborative, and we all teach as much as we learn. We launch new code many times a day, and have a lot of fun doing it. We are committed to building a cutting-edge company that is a place where engineers love to work.<br />Requirements <ul><li>Software engineering talent</li> <li>Experience building database-backed web applications</li> <li>Some knowledge of writing SQL for high performance</li> <li>Interest in solving performance bottlenecks both in the back-end and front-end</li> <li>Familiarity with relational databases and Unix/Linux</li> <li>Programming skills in a dynamic language (e.g., Ruby, Python)</li> <li>Experience with modern web frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django) and client-side technologies (JavaScript, CSS)</li> <li>Fast learner and fearless</li> <li>The number of years of professional experience you have isn’t important to us</li> </ul>Nice-to-Haves <ul><li>Startup experience</li> <li>We love an entrepreneurial mindset</li> <li>Proficiency programming Ruby (on Rails) Experience with Rails is definitely a plus</li> <li>Good design sense</li> </ul>Perks and Benefits <ul><li>Competitive salary</li> <li>Weekly tech talks</li> <li>Kendall Square office Twenty-five feet from the Red Line T Stop</li> <li>Hacker Continuing Education Wednesdays i.e., craft beer tasting and ping pong</li> </ul>Engineering Challenge<br />Want to impress us?
