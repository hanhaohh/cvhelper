We, the members of the Secure, Resilient Systems and Technology Group, have made our choice. We are here. We are computer scientists, software, hardware and electrical engineers, cryptographers, system analysts and security architects who share a common passion for helping solve some of the hardest technical problems relevant to National security. We pursue innovative, high-impact, practical research in small, focused teams. We succeed by participating in all R&amp;D phases, including problem analysis and innovative solution design, system architecture, rapid prototyping and field-testing, and ultimately transfer of our technology to DoD and Intelligence Community users, sponsors, and Industry. Being part of MIT, we also collaborate closely with academia and publish our research in top-tier venues. We are having fun. <br /><br />If you would like to pursue your passion for cutting-edge research and work on things that truly matter at a place that combines MIT’s culture of academic excellence, abundance of resources, and superior work-life balance, apply here to learn more. You may discover this is exactly the place you are looking for.<br /><br />Secure Software Systems Engineer / Scientist<br /><br />If selected, you will play a key role in creating and transitioning advanced technologies for ensuring high performance, resilience, and security of next-generation mission-critical computational systems. Our R&amp;D in this area focuses on a wide range of systems and applications: from high-performance computing and secure cloud computing systems to drones and satellites, to handheld devices and miniature sensors, to many others. Your initial project assignment will take into account the preferences and interests you express during the interview.<br /><br />Requirements: PhD degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computational Science, Mathematics, or related fields; in lieu of PhD, a Master’s with 4 or more years of relevant experience will be considered.
