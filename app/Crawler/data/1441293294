Data Scientist		Broad Institute		Cambridge, MA		<div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">The comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes is nearly complete, but major barriers exist in converting this information into patient benefit. Now, a critical goal in cancer research is to identify cancer vulnerabilities across a diversity of tumor subtypes. Such a capability would allow for the elucidation of the molecular targets against which therapeutics should be developed, and the identification of specific patient populations likely to respond to such targeted interventions. We are launching a new initiative to screen small-molecules at an unprecedented scale in cancer models spanning the genetic diversity of human cancer, in order to identify compounds with genotype-specific patterns of killing.<br /><br />As part of this effort, we are looking for a highly motivated and talented individual with a computational background to join the Cancer Program Data Science team. You will collaborate with scientists and engineers in a collegial work environment characterized by informality and intellectual rigor. By applying your computational and modeling skills to multimodal cancer data, you will drive the generation and testing of hypotheses leading to new biological insights.<br /><br />The Broad Institute provides a vibrant research environment with close links to top academic institutions across the Boston area and provides the potential for your contributions to be used and recognized worldwide.<br />CHARACTERISTIC DUTIES<br />Design and execute data analysis strategies to support research projects involving multimodal cancer datasets. <br />Together with other team members you will develop new methodologies for predictive modeling of high-dimensionality genomic data.<br />Explore novel data representation modes with emphasis on integrating diverse data types. <br />Conceive, implement and test statistical models; work with wet-lab researchers to translate these models into testable experiments; analyze data from experiments. <br />Present results to a broad range of non-computational staff. Prepare written reports and presentations for internal use and publication.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements:</strong><br /><br />QUALIFICATIONS<br />A PhD in a quantitative discipline (such as computer science, bioinformatics, physics; or in biology with a strong quantitative background).<br />Experience with analysis of real-world datasets, algorithm development and statistics.<br />Proficiency in at least one modern programming language. Experience with a scientific programming environment, such as R or MATLAB, is preferred.<br />Background in machine learning or biology is a big plus.<br />Knowledge of cancer biology or cancer genomics is a plus but is NOT required. Inclination to acquire such knowledge is.<br />Strong communication skills.<br />Fast learner, analytical thinker, creative, “hands-on”, self-starter, team player.<br /><br />EOE/Minorities/Females/Protected Veterans/Disabilities</div><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">The Broad Institute was launched to pioneer a new model of collaborative biomedical science that would transform biology and medicine. To accomplish these goals, we have built an amazing team of talented “Broadies” who work together to realize this transformation. <br />The Broad community includes professional scientists from many disciplines, software engineers and computational biologists, administrative staff, and students, as well as renowned researchers from partner institutions. We seek to cultivate an interdisciplinary, goal-oriented work environment that unleashes scientific creativity and empowers our people to pursue ambitious and critical projects. <br />Our work transcends traditional academic boundaries, giving Broad employees and affiliates access to an unparalleled biomedical research community across Harvard, the Harvard hospitals, MIT, and beyond. <br />People feel genuinely appreciated at the Broad Institute. The organization encourages different points of view and our jobs make us feel like we’re part of something meaningful.</div>
