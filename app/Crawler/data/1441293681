Through its SaaS platform, SkillsEQ provides students with the knowledge of what skills a job requires and what skills each academic course yields. This insight empowers students to choose courses with a clear understanding of how each course contributes to building a skill set necessary to be considered qualified for a particular job upon graduation. <br /><br />By standardizing the qualification requirements for jobs, SkillsEQ also enables hiring managers and HR departments to screen applicants rapidly and efficiently based upon quantified skill sets rather than college name, academic major, GPA, or experience. <br /><br />Schools offer thousands of courses to their students. Companies have hundreds of thousands of jobs they need staffed. Until now, there were no tools available to explain how the skills required by the jobs correlate to the courses offered by the schools. The result has been sixty six percent of hiring managers believing students are unprepared for the workplace, and college graduate hires only remaining twelve to sixteen months in their first job before leaving. SkillsEQ was developed to address the challenge common to both these market failures.<br /> <br />For the first time, clarity and confidence are now the norm for both students and hiring managers. <br /><br />Learn more at: <br /><br />Website: www.skillseq.com <br />Twitter: @skillseq <br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/skills-eq/1428755800669669</div>
