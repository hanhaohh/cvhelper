With the ever-increasing amount of technology available, a majority of recruiting agencies have forgotten the value of personal relationships. IT recruiters have largely been replaced by job board resume finders. When you're trying to build or become part of an IT staff, this lack of personal interaction isn't conducive to results. The Centrics Group prides itself on personal relationships and connecting the right IT professional with the right employer.</div>
