Signal/Image Processing and Data Analysis Engineer		MIT Lincoln Laboratory		Lexington, MA, US		<div class="rich-text" itemprop="description"><strong>Listing Info<br /><br /></strong>The Tactical Defense Systems Group works on air defense issues, particularly air vehicle survivability, the vulnerability of United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft to threat weapons systems, infrared and electronic countermeasures, and air surveillance for homeland defense. A strong emphasis is placed on performing tests and measurements that enable a thorough understanding of USAF and threat air defense systems. These activities include flight, ground-based, and laboratory testing of advanced sensor systems spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to optical frequencies using state-of-the-art instrumentation, followed by analysis of the recorded data. The group operates several highly instrumented testbed aircraft and ground-based sensors to support these efforts. The group also prototypes advanced sensor concepts and augments the instrumentation of existing sensors. The group conducts several major field testing campaigns each year in addition to performing extensive local testing to validate flight readiness.<br /><br />A signal / image processing and data analysis engineer is needed to assist with the development of systems to support laboratory/field testing with ground and airborne sensors. The developer will design, code, test, integrate and maintain the signal and image processing algorithms for various radar and optical systems. The candidate will also be responsible for the maintenance of legacy toolsets and the development of refinements for the signal processing of various remote sensing test assets. Ideal candidate is self-driven, has good communication skills and comfortable tasking and working with fellow engineers to create complete end-to-end systems. Occasional domestic travel to support field exercises may be required.<br /><br /><strong>Requirements<br /><br /></strong>Project, research, or practical work experience with RF-based systems, radar systems, sonar, imaging systems, IR systems or other related processing system is required. Applicants shall have experience working with big data sets, and knowledge of signal processing techniques for implementation in software or embedded systems. Experience of software design and engineering, real time operating systems and multi-threaded processing is also required.<br /><br />Applicant shall be experienced in C and C++ as well as the use of MATLAB<br />Run time optimization and system architecture design / integration (hardware/software interfacing ) experience is desirable. Experience with laboratory/field test equipment (spectrum analyzers, digital oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, etcâ€¦) is highly desirable.<br /><br />Master's Degree in a technical field. In lieu of an MS, BS and 3 years of directly applicable experience will be considered. Experience may be in either an academic or a commercial setting.<br /><br />MIT Lincoln Laboratory is an equal opportunity employer, and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, veteran status, or disability.<br />U.S. citizenship is required.<br /><br /></div><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">MIT Lincoln Laboratory is a federally funded research and development center chartered to apply advanced technology to problems of national security.
