We help school districts, charter networks, and state governments conduct surveys of students, parents, teachers, and staff. Our classroom surveys collect feedback about teachers, and our school surveys gather data about the school environment and administrators. We believe that stakeholder feedback is a powerful professional development tool, and we believe that stakeholder surveys--when done correctly--make educator evaluation systems more fair and more effective.<br /><br />At the heart of our work is the Panorama Platform, a flexible, highly-secure, easy-to-use, and low-cost technology platform we built for conducting surveys and analyzing data in the school environment. With Panorama, schools can administer surveys online and on paper. Panorama analyzes this data and presents teachers and administrators with clear and constructive feedback that they can use to improve their teaching and their schools.</div>
