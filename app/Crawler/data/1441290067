Our roots in the hard-working world of construction help shape our culture and the way we work together. Bringing a building out of the ground requires the tireless effort of a diverse group of people - experts in designing, managing and creating - and we think developing software is a very similar process.<br /><br />FieldLens is looking for innovators. For doers. For smart people that look forward to their work because it&rsquo;s challenging and because it&rsquo;s going to make a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives. We need professionals with domain expertise that get a rush from thinking differently, working collaboratively and from building things that matter.<br /><br />Is this you? Do you share our values? Does this sound like the kind of environment where you&rsquo;ll feel inspired to do your best and most meaningful work? If the answer is yes, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</div><div class="rich-text" itemprop="description">The mobile-first platform for construction communication. Every task. Every conversation.

We’ve lived through the miscommunications, the mistakes, the lack of critical information and all the other field issues that can make a stressful day even worse. With decades of construction experience between us, we know how it feels when construction project teams aren’t working together the way they should.<br /><br />We always knew there should be a better way. When we couldn’t find one, we decided to build it ourselves. We put together a team of top-notch technology developers and FieldLens was born.</div>
